.............................Machine learning models for drug discovery based on activity on human alpha-Glucosidase..............................................

Machine learning models which are trained on PubChem datasets `AID 2100` and `AID 2242` to obtain drug candidates (activators and inhibitors of alpha glucosidase) for Type II diabetes and Pompe's disease.
`AID 2100` and `AID 2242` are PubChem datasets for inhibitors and activators of Human Alpha-glucosidase enzyme respectively. 

Mold2 was used to compute 777 molecular descriptors of the compounds obtained from PubChem. These molecular descriptors were used to train different ML algorithms to predict whether a given compound is an activator/inhibitor of Alpha-glucosidase.
